# Responsive-Website
Treehouse Project 2
This assignment was to create a mobile-first layout with two breakpoints, 
using my own profile photo along with portfolio images that Treehouse provided.
Treehouse provided three mockups of the site, at 320px, 768px, and 1024px.  I used HTML 
and CSS to reproduce the designs, trying out the srcset and sizes attributes to make the 
images responsive.
